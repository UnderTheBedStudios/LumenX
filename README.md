Hello, so this is my game engine that I'm allowing people to use.
This will only be available to Windows x64 systems, (Mainly due to the fact I don't have a MacOS or a Linux operating system and I don't know how to build to them Via the JetBrains Rider IDE I'm using)
It's not ready yet but I'm sure it will get work done.
It will most likely use DX11/DX12 as its rendering engine
Nothing would be possible without the tutorials from Game Engine Series (Yes that's his name from YT)
This is a link to his YT if you want to make your own game engine.
